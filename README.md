# ToothScan - SmileSaver

Your Dental Health Assistant

## ðŸ¦· About
ToothScan is software that is designed to help patients with initial dental examinations automatically using machine learning technology. Our basic idea is that the patient's dental images are analyzed using a machine learning model based on object recognition and classified whether it is a caries or cavities. Because caries and cavities are similar things but are actually different. And both have different handling too. We will provide tips to prevent the condition from getting worse with home treatments for dental caries and directly advise users to go to the nearest health center if the patient has cavities.
